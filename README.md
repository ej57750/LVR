Main and Mini Project

We've already presented the Mini Project (miniproject.py and test.txt) to the professor

The Main Project consists of tasks 

~ 1.1*, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5

~ 2.3, 2.4*, 2.5

*1.1 shows an error I was unable to fix but the function itself still works correctly
(check the examples just below), it is in its own .lean file (oneone.lean)

*2.4 is there

Does anyone actually read these?
I'm so tired.
I wonder if you can tell which one of us did most of the work.
